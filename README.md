## System Requirements

 - Please follow the MySQL Installation Guide and install MySQL in your system and it must be active and running
 - Your system must have node v16 or above installed in it

## Application Installation

 - Download/Clone the code from https://github.com/nathmonoj/hapijs_api_poc
 - Go to the project folder "hapijs_api_poc"
 - ```bash run command "npm install" ```
 - You will see the "node_modules" folder got generated and the project is ready now

## Setting Up Application

 - Go to the project folder "hapijs_api_poc" and run command "node serversetup"
 - The final console log will be "Server setup Completed..." and your application environment is now setup and configured

## Initiating Application
